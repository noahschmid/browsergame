# 2D Jump N' Run browser game using Node.js and SocketIO
This was a small project I did a few years ago when I was learning about web dev and it includes a few interesting concepts: Loading and displaying tiled maps, collision detection and lag compensation. It's a pretty hacky project and I cringe when I look back at my old code, but maybe it is still helpful for other people.
